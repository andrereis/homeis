                    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="sectionText">"Home is..." is a game developed during the 2019 edition of the Global Game Jam (GGJ). Participants in GGJ attempt their best at making games over 48 hours, based on a common theme announced at the start of the event. For the 2019 edition of GGJ, the theme was "What home means to you."

            <div class="sectionText">
                
                <p>In the early hours of GGJ, we focused on building a team and finding a direction for our game. With André, Nattasha, Pablo, and Ricardo together as a team, concepts started firing off. A lot of the ideas seemed to have potential, but we had to pick one and get to work. So, through many rounds of adding and removing contenders we arrived at the idea, we ultimately would develop.</p>
                    
                    <p>With the direction set, we had the structure of the game in place. Children in a playground are made to wonder what home means to each of them, and that's just what we would show the players through a collection of minigames. As development went along, though we sometimes pondered about introducing new things to the project, we tried to manage the scope as best as we could, and so we limited the experience to three minigames connected with a menu and scene of the children introducing their games.</p>
                    
                    <p>About halfway through the project, we turned our attention to trying to adding sound to our project. When trying to find someone who could help us in this area where we had no expertise, we found Elora who despite already being a member of another jam team offered to help with recording voice and composing music. With Elora now helping the team, we quickly recruited volunteers to give voice to our characters, bringing a new layer to the game. The music composed, a song for each minigame, fell victim to time. Final bug fixing and the rush of delivering a build to the GGJ servers on time made it so that we didn't manage to put it into the game. You can, however, listen to the music below.</p>
                    
                    <p>With the jam finished, the team was happy to deliver something that felt like a surprisingly finished and cohesive experience for the time allowed by the event. You can find more about our game through the images and video below. You can also try the game yourself in the links provided.</p>
